# NLP Capstone Project: Text Classification

## 📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a simple text classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The objective is to preprocess textual data and train models that can accurately assign predefined categories to input text.

Both traditional NLP methods (using NLTK) and modern deep learning approaches (using Keras) will be incorporated.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Google Colab (for model training)
- PyCharm (for local development)
- Git/GitHub (version control)

## 🧑‍🧬 Approach
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize text using NLTK.
2. **Model Building**: Train deep learning models for text classification on Google Colab using Keras.
3. **Model Inference**: Run predictions locally using PyCharm.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Elvis-Kiilu2/NLP_Capstone-_Project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train models (Colab) and export.
4. Run classification script locally:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Integrate advanced architectures like Transformers (e.g., BERT).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and model ensembling.
- Deploy model using a web framework like Streamlit or Flask.
